Release Management
==================

After pylint 2.0, which is scheduled to be released somewhere around in
July, we are planning to do releases more often. The intentional plan is
to have a minor release for each two or three weeks, having also the next
major bump planned in advance.

In order for these short minor releases to be manageable, the plan is to
have at most ten issues assigned per minor release. We can try, though,
to assign few than ten issues per release, so we could schedule a fix
really quickly, if the need arises, thus giving ourselves time for the
unplanned.

Although, to advance the capabilities of the inference engine
and of Pylint in general, we cannot focus ourselves completely on working
only for minor releases and as such, the release schedule will have gaps
for working for the next major release of astroid, indifferent on the
corresponding version.
